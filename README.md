 # Scanner Monitor, Recorder, and Transcriber #

## Description
Scanner Monitor, Recorder, and Transcriber is a tool designed to monitor, record, and transcribe scanner audio. The script can monitor a scan feed from Broadcastify or any other provider (even a local server). On detection of audio output, the script will start recording the audio which is then stored and transcribed using Google Speech to Text.

Scanner audio can be a bit on teh harsh side as far as quality, but the system does its best to transcribe the contents. Keywords can be used to trigger and event like a tone, email, or a popup alert to notify you when something specific is found.
